## Cucumber Spring Integration
### Overview
 Cucumber is a very powerful testing framework written in the Ruby programming language, which follows the BDD (behavior-driven development) methodology. It enables developers to write high-level use cases in plain text that can be verified by non-technical stakeholders, and turn them into executable tests, written in a language called Gherkin.
