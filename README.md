## Cucumber Spring Integration
### Overview
 Cucumber is a very powerful testing framework written in the Ruby programming language, which follows the BDD (behavior-driven development) methodology. It enables developers to write high-level use cases in plain text that can be verified by non-technical stakeholders, and turn them into executable tests, written in a language called Gherkin.

### What is Gherkin?
Gherkin is a set of grammar rules that makes plain text structured enough for Cucumber to understand. The scenario above is written in Gherkin.

Gherkin serves multiple purposes:

Unambiguous executable specification
Automated testing using Cucumber
Document how the system actually behaves

### What are Step Definitions?
Step definitions connect Gherkin steps to programming code. A step definition carries out the action that should be performed by the step. So step definitions hard-wire the specification to the implementation.
